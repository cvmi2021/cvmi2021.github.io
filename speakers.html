He completed a postdoctoral fellowship in the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (Ron McKay) at the NINDS/NIH in Bethesda MD developing stem cell applications for high-throughput, high-content platform drug discovery. In 2007, Dr Boyd joined Evotec AG developing high-content screens using primary stem cells and stem cell lines to identify new drugs for regenerative medicine. In 2008. Dr Boyd moved to the Laboratory of Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration at the Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard Medical School in Cambridge MA working to develop cell based and high-content analysis for neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and ALS, and in 2014 became an independent laboratory head. In 2015, Dr Boyd was the senior manager for Functional Biology at the Beryllium Discovery
Corp and was team leader of the Functional Biology Core.
In 2017, he moved to Pfizer Inc (Cambridge MA) and he is the current lead of the High Content Technology Centre, which supports team project effort to develop and validate robust high-content and phenotypic assays for compound screening across multiple research areas including metabolic diseases, inflammation and immunology, rare diseases and neuroscience.

                <span>Berton Earnshaw, Ph.D. Recursion Pharmaceuticals </span><strong>(Confirmed)</strong> <br>
                <strong>Bio:</strong>
                <span>Berton joined the founding team of Red Brain Labs as director of operations and data science, where he worked with current team members Ben Mabey and Mason Victors to optimize call centers using machine learning and simulation. In 2014, Red Brain Labs was acquired by Savvysherpa where, as a Senior Scientist and Principal, Berton led various research projects applying machine learning to insurance claims and medical records with the goal of improving healthcare outcomes.
Berton earned his bachelor’s degree and master’s degree in mathematics from BYU, and in 2007 earned a Ph.D. in math from the University of Utah, where he designed biophysical models of protein trafficking at synapses during episodes of learning and memory formation

                <span>Juan Caicedo, Ph.D. Broad Institute. </span><strong>(Confirmed)</strong> <br>
                <strong>Bio:</strong>
                <span>Juan C. Caicedo is a Schmidt Fellow at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. He is pioneering the use of deep learning and machine learning methods to analyze microscopy images and high-resolution genetic data. He is also exploring reinforcement learning, a method of training algorithms to optimize biological experiments. He collaborates with the Cell Circuits and Epigenomics Programs and the Imaging Platform.
Caicedo received his Ph.D. in computer engineering from the National University of Colombia. He completed internships at Google Research, Microsoft Research, and Queen Mary University of London as a grad student. As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, he studied object detection problems in internet scale image collections with deep reinforcement learning.

                <span>Gerhard Hummer, Professor, Max Planck Institute of Biophysics. </span><strong>(Confirmed)</strong> <br>
                <strong>Bio:</strong>
                <span>Gerhard Hummer studied physics at the University of Vienna, Austria. He received his PhD in 1992 for work at the University of Vienna, Austria, and the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen, Germany. He joined the Los Alamos National Laboratory (NM, USA), first as a postdoctoral fellow (1993-1996) and then as a group leader (1996-1999). In 1999, he moved to the National Institutes of Health (MD, USA), where he became Chief of the Theoretical Biophysics Section, and Deputy Chief of the Laboratory of Chemical Physics, NIDDK. In 2013 he was appointed as scientific member and director at the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics in Frankfurt, Germany, where he heads the Department of Theoretical Biophysics. Since 2016, he is also Professor of Biophysics at the Goethe University in Frankfurt.
Gerhard Hummer uses molecular simulations, integrative modeling, and theory to study the structure, dynamics, and function of biological systems at the molecular level. His current research focuses on membrane dynamics and remodeling processes in cellular homeostasis, autophagy, and viral infection. Gerhard Hummer is a Fellow of the American Physical Society (2005), a Senior Fellow of the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (2015), and a recipient of the Raymond and Beverly Sackler International Prize in Biophysics (2010) and the Nancy Nossal Scientific Mentorship Award at the NIH (2010).

                <strong>Speaker:</strong>
                <span>Keith Chang, Ph.D., Pennsylvania State University. </span><strong>(Tentative)</strong> <br>
                <strong>Bio:</strong>
                <span>Dr. Keith Cheng is interested in making fundamental contributions to the understanding of genetic and molecular mechanisms involved in human biology and disease. The lab is interested in genetic aspects of human disease, use of model systems such as the zebrafish, contribution to web-based scientific resources and new, potentially high-throughput forms of 3D imaging.
Some of the Cheng lab's specific work is aimed at increasing understanding of the basis of phenotypic variability, particularly as it may impact cancer; basic mechanisms underlying the relationship between human skin pigmentation and skin cancer; contributing to web-based infrastructures for science, education and public service; and working toward a 3D derivative of histology that also allows the identification and characterization of all cell types but utilizes the computer to define slice angle, thickness, point of view and definition of tissues of interest. Obvious implications include automation of phenotyping, including diagnostics.
