           <strong> Abstract:</strong> Visual cell phenotyping is the characterization and quantification of observable cellular traits in images. Recently, cellular phenotyping has undergone a massive overhaul in terms of the scale, resolution, and throughput, attributable to the advances across electronic, optical, and chemical technologies for imaging cells. Coupled with the rapid acceleration of deep-learning based computational tools, these advances have opened up new avenues for innovation across a wide variety of high-throughput cell biology applications. In this talk, we will review applications where deep learning is powering the recognition, profiling, and prediction of visual phenotypes to answer important biological questions. As the complexity and scale of imaging assays increase to understand biological models, deep learning offers computational solutions to improve our ability for studying more precise details of cellular phenotypes.

                <span>Juan C. Caicedo is a Schmidt Fellow at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. He is pioneering the use of deep learning and machine learning methods to analyze microscopy images and high-resolution genetic data. He is also exploring reinforcement learning, a method of training algorithms to optimize biological experiments. He collaborates with the Cell Circuits and Epigenomics Programs and the Imaging Platform.
		Caicedo received his Ph.D. in computer engineering from the National University of Colombia. He completed internships at Google Research, Microsoft Research, and Queen Mary University of London as a grad student. As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, he studied object detection problems in internet scale image collections with deep reinforcement learning.

		<strong>Speaker Bio:</strong>
                <span>Gerhard Hummer studied physics at the University of Vienna, Austria. He received his PhD in 1992 for work at the University of Vienna, Austria, and the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen, Germany. He joined the Los Alamos National Laboratory (NM, USA), first as a postdoctoral fellow (1993-1996) and then as a group leader (1996-1999). In 1999, he moved to the National Institutes of Health (MD, USA), where he became Chief of the Theoretical Biophysics Section, and Deputy Chief of the Laboratory of Chemical Physics, NIDDK. In 2013 he was appointed as scientific member and director at the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics in Frankfurt, Germany, where he heads the Department of Theoretical Biophysics. Since 2016, he is also Professor of Biophysics at the Goethe University in Frankfurt.
		Gerhard Hummer uses molecular simulations, integrative modeling, and theory to study the structure, dynamics, and function of biological systems at the molecular level. His current research focuses on membrane dynamics and remodeling processes in cellular homeostasis, autophagy, and viral infection. Gerhard Hummer is a Fellow of the American Physical Society (2005), a Senior Fellow of the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (2015), and a recipient of the Raymond and Beverly Sackler International Prize in Biophysics (2010) and the Nancy Nossal Scientific Mentorship Award at the NIH (2010).

		<strong>Speaker Bio:</strong>
                <span>Kristen Maynard, Ph.D. joined the Lieber Institute in the summer of 2012. Her research uses molecular and cellular biology in combination with behavioral techniques to investigate signaling events governing neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. In particular, she is studying how changes in the transcriptional regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), an activity-regulated gene important for neuroplasticity, impact dendrite morphology, synaptic function, and behavior. Dr. Maynard earned her bachelor’s degree in Neuroscience from Bowdoin College in 2006 and her PhD in Neuroscience from Yale University in 2012. Her dissertation work in the Yale Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying dendrite arborization and spine formation in the developing cerebral cortex. Dr. Maynard received specialized training in translational research through the Yale Medical Research Scholars Program, and she continues to pursue questions at the interface of basic biology and human disease at the Lieber Institute.

		<strong>Speaker Bio:</strong>
                <span>Dr. Keith Cheng is interested in making fundamental contributions to the understanding of genetic and molecular mechanisms involved in human biology and disease. The lab is interested in genetic aspects of human disease, use of model systems such as the zebrafish, contribution to web-based scientific resources and new, potentially high-throughput forms of 3D imaging.
		Some of the Cheng lab's specific work is aimed at increasing understanding of the basis of phenotypic variability, particularly as it may impact cancer; basic mechanisms underlying the relationship between human skin pigmentation and skin cancer; contributing to web-based infrastructures for science, education and public service; and working toward a 3D derivative of histology that also allows the identification and characterization of all cell types but utilizes the computer to define slice angle, thickness, point of view and definition of tissues of interest. Obvious implications include automation of phenotyping, including diagnostics.
